# YelpCamp
YelpCamp is a basic camp booking website using which you can view different campgrounds available and book them.
If you run or own a campground you can even add your campground to YelpCamp.
The website also uses a simple login and sign up using username and password for authentication.

This project is created using MongoDB, Express and Node.js. Bootstrap is used for frontend css styling and passport.js is used for providing authentication.
